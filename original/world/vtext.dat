0001    That is an illegal character.                                  
0002    This usage of punctuation has me mystified.
0003    A number here is nonsense to me.
0004    Nothing can follow a quick direction word.
0005    That word is utterly beyond my limited vocabulary.
0006    I was expecting a verb there.    
0007    It seems to be empty.
0008    That is a second adverb. I can't understand it.
0009    That is a second verb (to me at least). I'm puzzled.
0010    How can I communicate with a non-sentient object?
0011    If you wish to talk to someone, you must do it yourself.
0012    I'm expecting a comma here.
0013    The word "and" doesn't make sense to me here.
0014    That seems to be trying to be a question, but it doesn't fit the
0014    allowed form.
0015    A letter cannot directly follow a number.
0016    This type of verb cannot be followed by anything.
0017    Your attempt at communication is utterly bizarre!
0018    Two adjectives are never necessary. Try choosing the best one.
0019    No object is allowed here.
0020    Your sentence is not of a form I understand.
0021    I don't know how to use that verb and preposition together the
0021    way you used them.
0022    Multiple objects are not permitted here.
0023    All but what?
0024    I don't understand that object construction.
0025    Your input is too complicated. Please shorten it.
0026    An adjective cannot modify "all".
0027    Something more is necessary after this verb.
0028    I don't understand that sentence.
0029    WORLD. C  Version 1.01 Copyright 1987 J.D. McDonald  GOOD LUCK!
0030    Don't you dare go back! After you volunteered to come here (and
0030    get out of latrine duty), you'd die of embarrassment if you
0030    turned back.
0031    As you reach the top of the pass, you encounter a region of
0031    shimmering air similar to that seen above. As you enter it, at
0031    first it seems only to slow your motion a bit. But eventually it
0031    springs back and propels you back into the valley.
0031    You are trapped!
0032    "Down" isn't enough. Specify a compass point.
0033    There's no way to do that without the proper shoes.
0034    It's too small for you to stand on.
0035    That location isn't used yet.
0036    You wandered around in the mossy underbrush and ended up back
0036    where you started.
0037    You are impaled on a sharp rock a few meters above the ground. 
0038    You are at the bottom of the chasm, with not a single intact
0038    bone in your body.
0039    There is no fire-starting material around.
0040    I don't need to, thank you.
0041    You wet your pants, you fool!
0042    That really felt good!!
0043    You idiot! You dumb turd!! You have shit in your pants!!!
0044    If you pray enough, your prayers may be answered.
0045    A deafening clap of thunder hits you out of the thin air. A deep
0045    voice intones: "You have wandered helplessly long enough. I will
0045    now return you to life."
0046    Unfortunately, you can't do that while dead.
0047    You have not attained the status necessary for walking on water
0047    It's not clear whether you ever will.
0048    Ridiculous!
0049    Wheeeeeeee!
0050    Trying to figure that out has me climbing the walls.
0051    Running slowly is a rather impossible feat, don't you think? 
0052    There's nothing here to swim in!
0053    You're carrying too much. Better get rid of something.
0054    Swimming there is either impossible or dangerous.
0055       
0055                       YOU ARE DEAD
0055    
0055
0055       After a time you notice that being dead isn't quite
0055       what you had expected. Despite obvious problems
0055       doing certain common things, you can still get about.
0055       Perhaps the situation isn't hopeless.
0055   
0055   
0055   
0056    You seem to have lost your way.
0057    I can't go up or down a compass point!
0058    It's impossible to go that way.
0059    You can't go there.
0060    You can't do that while juggling all that.
0061    You'd get tangled up in seaweed. Better not.
0062    You are carrying:
0063    You are wearing:
0064    You are empty-handed.
0065    No turning back now! Onward!
0066    I can't seem to find it.
0067    You're carrying it.
0068    You're wearing it.
0069    I can't use that word the way you used it.
0070    That's ambiguous.
0071    Huh?
0072    You are carrying too many items already.
0073    I can't find the bag.
0074    There's no water here.
0075    Done.
0076    It's happy where it is. Don't trouble it.
0077    That's not a container.
0078    That container isn't here.
0079    It's too heavy.
0080    It's too quick.
0081    Taken.
0082    Dropped.
0083    You're not wearing it.
0084    You must specify exactly what you wish to wear.
0085    You can't wear that.
0086    Wearing two of these is stupid.
0087    Okay, you are now wearing it.
0088    You will have to take it off first.
0089    You don't have it.
0090    Put it in what?
0091    That container is not readily available.
0092    It's already there.
0093    It won't fit.
0094    I don't understand that.
0095    I don't know how to do that.
0096    There's nothing special about it.
0097    You can't look into that.
0098    There's nothing to read.
0099    Going around with no shoes on is unhealthy. You might
0099    step on some poison bug.
0100    You were warned! There are some really obnoxious
0100    creatures crawling around on this alien world.
0100    You just stepped on one.
0101    Do you really wish to quit?
0102    Please answer the question "Y" or "N".
0103    Do you need general help or a specific hint?
0103    If you need general help, answer yes to the prompt.
0103    If you answer no I will offer hints based on your 
0103    present situation.
0104    You don't have the key. 
0105    Some messages (such as this one) may be too big for the screen.
0105    If so, you may proceed by typing the 'return' key. If you don't
0105    like this feature, it may be disabled by the NOMORE command and
0105    enabled buy MORE.
0105      
0105    I will attempt to the best of my ability to follow the commands
0105    you enter. I accept full sentences, but in general short 
0105    commands are better than long ones. You can put as many 
0105    sentences as you wish on a line if you separate them by periods
0105    or "then". If you try to do something I don't understand, I will
0105    try my best to give a meaningful and helpful reply. If, however,
0105    you put in something grammatically correct, I may not be too 
0105    helpful. If you use multiple sentences on a line, I may give my
0105    response far below where you typed the line, in some cases so
0105    far that your command has scrolled off the page. I look at the 
0105    first nine (9) letters of a word, and usually you must type the
0105    whole word. However, a single direction N,NE,E,SE,S,SW,W,NW,U or
0105    D preceded by an optional adverb is the best way of simple
0105    travel. Location descriptions are given in long form the first
0105    time you visit a place; afterwards shorter forms are used, 
0105    unless you enter VERBOSE. VERBOSE is canceled by the BRIEF
0105    command. At any time you may get a long description and a list
0105    of objects visible at a place by typing LOCATE or L. The command
0105    SUPERBRIEF will suppress even more messages. I will give you a
0105    list of what you are carrying if you enter INVENTORY or I.
0105
0105    Some objects must be distinguished by referring to them with 
0105    adjectives, such as RED SHIRT or GREEN SHIRT. A noun can be
0105    preceded by its proper adjective, or by none at all. Improper
0105    adjectives, or unnecessary ones, will evoke rude responses.
0105    Sometimes you must refer to an object with a phrase using "OF",
0105    such as in TAKE THE JAR OF JELLY. In this case there can be no
0105    adjective before the second noun.
0105 
0105    Particularly useful are commands such as TAKE ALL or DROP ALL,
0105    which can operate on over 25 items at once. You can also say
0105    TAKE ALL BUT GRAPE JELLY etc.
0105      
0105    You will find that particular objects are containers, and thus
0105    are useful for carrying other things around. This is most useful
0105    as you can't carry very many objects in your hands at once.
0105    Certain things can be worn, and usually should be worn. You get
0105    points for getting samples for your expedition, or sometimes for
0105    performing certain actions. For the specimens to count for full
0105    points, you must be carrying or wearing them. There are many 
0105    dangers here, so you may die a few times. Not to worry though,
0105    there is a way to resurrect yourself. If you do some things 
0105    carefully, you may live longer.
0105      
0105    If you wish you may save the present position in the game
0105    by entering SAVE, and you may then restart at this point by
0105    entering RESTORE. 
0105
0106    ***** THERE ARE TOO MANY ITEMS HERE FOR "ALL" .....
0106    ... YOU MUST SPECIFY SOME INDIVIDUALLY.****
0107    That noun and adjective together mean nothing to me.
0108    All the standing trees around here are so covered in moss that
0108    climbing them would be very dangerous.
0109    Crawling is a slow way to get around... and watch out for nasty
0109    bugs...  but okay, if you wish... crawl.
0110    What else does one swim in?
0111    What else does one swim in? Horsepiss?
0112    I don't understand that use of "of".
0113    You aren't close enough.
0114    The camera, having noticed that it isn't out in the open, 
0114    refuses to even try to take a picture.
0115    The camera, in a clear soothing voice, says "Don't waste the
0115    taxpayers money on something you already took a picture of."
0116    The camera emits a flash of light, and in a few seconds plops a
0116    picture of the pterodactyls on the ground.
0117    The camera swivels it lens appendage a bit and announces, in a
0117    disgusted voice "You better find something interesting to take
0117    a picture of. If you think am going to take one of YOU, you are
0117    far too vain."
0118    You're already at the end of the trail.
0119    Behind the horsetails is a small cave, the home of the flying
0119    reptiles.
0120    It's too dark to see very well. Try again when there is better
0120    light.
0121    There isn't enough light to read by.
0122    Better not try swimming when it is dark. There might be
0122    nocturnal carnivores in the lake.
0123    Trying to climb in the dark is dangerous. Don't do it.
0124    It is now nighttime. There are many brilliant stars in the sky
0124    so you can still get around.
0125    The red sun has already set, and the blue sun is getting low.
0125    Soon it will be night.
0126    The blue sun has risen over the horizon. It is morning twilight.
0127    As you climb over the edge of the bowl, you lose your footing on
0127    the slippery surface and slide down one side and back up the
0127    other, almost but not quite out. This up-and-down motion
0127    continues a few times until you come to rest at the bottom.
0128    The inhabitants are packed in tight. It doesn't look safe.
0129    It's very dark in there. Although grues have not reached this
0129    planet yet (it's a long way from Cambridge, MA where some
0129    slipshod genetic engineer created them), still you might fall
0129    over something and break your neck.
0130    You find it impossible to walk through the barrier.
0130    As you enter it, It begins to feel like you are walking through
0130    molasses. Every second you stay in it you slow down more. You
0130    are barely able to retreat before you are stopped permanently 
0130    inside the barrier.
0131    The sides are too steep and slippery. You are stuck.
0132    The door is closed.
0133    The lowest bar is just above your grasp.
0134    The camera makes a small beep, and after a few moments emits a
0134    photo of some Martians.
0135    The camera says in a bored voice, "I already took a picture of
0135    those things." Nothing else happens.
0136    You caught the lower crosspiece of the tower and climbed on up.
0137    You asked for it! 
0138    The lowest horizontal piece is out of your reach and the sides
0138    are too slick.
0139    With all that weight, you can't quite reach the bottom rung
0139    even if you jump with all your might. ( Which is depleted by the
0139    thin air.)
0140    The camera look around with it's sensor head, looks at amazing
0140    creatures nearby, and refuses to take a picture. Being itself
0140    electrical, it appears to be unimpressed with such mundane(?)
0140    creatures.
0141    In the distance you see many moving flashes of light, somewhat
0141    like large fireflies. If you try to approach them, they dart 
0141    away.
0142    You are now able to get closer to the flashing lights. It is
0142    clear that they are living creatures - or maybe "creatures"
0142    isn't quite the correct word. They seem to have no material
0142    substance at all - you can, for example see through most of the
0142    space one of them occupies. They are round balls about 30 
0142    centimeters across, whose spherical outer shells glow red or
0142    blue. A small white dot glows brightly in the center, and bolts
0142    of lightning shoot out to their outer rim. Although they must be
0142    creatures of pure energy, it is clear that they can move matter,
0142    as they usually travel on the ground, leaving trails behind. 
0142    Sometimes they can jump up a meter or two off the ground. It
0142    looks like contacting one of them might prove a shocking
0142    experience.
0142    (Since this area looks like Mars, we might as well call them
0142    Martians, even though the real Mars is light-years away.)
0143    Several Martians are sitting in the ?chairs? . It seems that
0143    they enjoy the gorgeous view here as much as you do.
0144    Several Martians can be seen going in and out of the little
0144    holes, which seem to be their homes. They can squeeze through
0144    openings somewhat smaller than their normal size.
0145    There are many Martians in the small building. Most of them are
0145    sitting on the stools, doing nothing. Some are hopping up and 
0145    down in a little dance, sometimes alone, sometimes together.
0145    When a red-rimmed one touches a blue-rimmed one a large display 
0145    of lightning occurs in both of them. One particularly bright one
0145    sits on the stool in the center of the room and emits sparks
0145    which reach several centimeters outside its normal rim. Close 
0145    observation shows that a sort of synchronism exists between the 
0145    flashes of all the inhabitants. The whole effect is that of an 
0145    unearthly (and silent!) disco.
0146    The inhabitants of the bar are having a rousing good time.
0146    (Probably better than you are!)
0147    There are numerous Martians sitting in the dimples in the hill. 
0147    They seem to be watching others in the bowl below, who (which?)
0147    are engaged in a game of hockey. They slide around the bowl
0147    trying to get control of the puck, or, barring that, attack 
0147    members of the opposing team (although to you they all look 
0147    alike).
0147    The object of the game appears to be to knock the puck out of
0147    the bowl through one of the three low spots in the rim.
0148    There is a game of hockey in the arena.
0149    There are several Martians here, taking out the garbage.
0150    Although you try to avoid them, you have touched one of the
0150    Martians. It was indeed a shocking experience.
0151    The Martians in the bowl are so pre-occupied with their game
0151    that they don't notice you until one bumps into you, generating
0151    huge sparks and the general effect of a lightning bolt.
0152    The air here is rather cold, very dry, and somewhat low on
0152    oxygen, leaving you a bit breathless.
0153    Don't spoil the environment any more. Go find the one you 
0153    already took.
0154    Just as it becomes dark, the flashing lights begin to out.
0155    Just as dawn begins, the flashing lights are all disappearing.
0156    You aren't near any bowl.
0157    The Martians don't like the idea of you disturbing their game.
0157    They prevent you from dropping the rock in their midst. They do
0157    this by electrocuting you.
0158    The boulder slides down the smooth surface and hits the puck,
0158    which slides up and out the other side of the bowl. The boulder
0158    comes to rest in the bottom.
0159    The boulder slides down the smooth surface and hits the puck,
0159    which slide up and almost, but not quite, out of the bowl. Both
0159    settle in the bottom.
0160    The boulder slides across the bowl and out the other side.
0161    The boulder slides across the bowl, almost but not quite popping
0161    out. It ends up at the bottom.
0162    Smash!!!! The boulder has pulverized all the other items you
0162    left in the bowl!
0163    There's something in the center, but you can't tell what.
0164    As you reach for the diamond, it falls out of its mount, lands
0164    on a rock, and shatters into dust.
0165    As you reach for the diamond, it falls out of its mounting,
0165    landing safely on the moss.
0166    You have put yourself right in the focus of all those mirrors, 
0166    which follow the suns. You are burned to a crisp.
0167    I'm afraid that trying to contact these creatures is not a very
0167    likely event. They don't seem at all interested in you (unless
0167    you bother them).
0168    Martians? What Martians? You must be suffering from some sort
0168    of hallucinations.
0169    Several moving lights begin to appear around the bowl where you
0169    are stuck. Some of them are getting close so you can see that
0169    they are living creatures - or maybe "creatures" isn't quite the
0169    correct word. They seem to have no material substance at all -
0169    you can, for example, see through most of the space one of them
0169    occupies. They are round balls about 30 centimeters across,
0169    whose spherical outer shells glow red or blue. A small white dot
0169    glows brightly in the center, and bolts of lightning shoot out
0169    to their outer rim. 
0169    Although they must be creatures of pure energy, it is clear that
0169    they can move matter, as they usually travel on the ground,
0169    leaving trails behind. Sometimes they can jump up a meter or two
0169    off the ground. It looks like contacting one of them might prove
0169    a shocking experience. It appears that you have gotten yourself
0169    stuck in the bottom of their stadium. They are preparing to play
0169    some sort of game.
0169    (Since this area looks like Mars, we might as well call them
0169    Martians, even though the real Mars is light-years away.)
0170    The barrier is miles high. You can't get over it.
0171    The Martians, wishing to help you out of your predicament (and
0171    also clear their hockey arena), try to push you out of the bowl.
0171    However, their energetic manner of doing this is not compatible
0171    with your nervous system. 
0172    Your object hits the barrier, is slowed to a crawl by some sort
0172    of friction, and slowly drops to the ground.
0173    The inside of the holes is pitch black, but through the daytime
0173    glare you can see some red, blue and white lights flickering in
0173    the corners.
0174    No one is home.
0175    Anything you could use is already there.
0176    There's nothing special about these particular stools.
0177    Most of the stools are nothing special. But as you approach
0177    the one in the center, a spark jumps out from the metal knob and
0177    shocks you.
0178    Better not! You'd spend several turns in jail!
0179    Choke! Gasp! Aargh! Your stomach feels rather queasy.
0180    Ummmm. Delicious.
0181    That didn't seem to agree with you too well.
0182    You can't eat that.
0183    The Space Patrol wouldn't approve at all!!!!!
0184    The cold clear water is delicious!
0185    I can't seem to find them.
0186    You're carrying them.
0187    You're wearing them.
0188    They're too heavy.
0189    You're not wearing them.
0190    Okay, you're now wearing them.
0191    They're already there.
0192    They won't fit.
0193    There's nothing special about them.
0194    You will have to take them off first.
0195    You don't have them.
0196    With what? Your fingernails?
0197    You don't have any sapphire!
0198    The sapphire is all rounded. It can't cut anything.
0199    You don't have any diamond!
0200    I don't see any window here!
0201    Somebody already destroyed the plate glass window.
0202    As you finish scratching a circle in the glass, it breaks loose,
0202    falling safely on the sandy ground on the other side of the 
0202    wall.
0203    Going around vandalizing things won't help you win the game!
0204    Perhaps you're thinking of using the wire as a rope?
0204    It's intended as an electrical appliance, nothing else.
0205    There's no tower here!
0206    There's no knob here!
0207    That was a shocking experience!
0208    I would hope that all Space Patrol members were upstanding!
0209    If you wish!
0210    I see no purpose in that!
0211    While carrying it? That's too recursive for me!
0212    You are standing on a plate of glass.
0213    I see no wire here.
0214    You can't take the center of the wire. Go find an end.
0215    A long wire runs along the trail.
0216    As you walked, you picked up the wire.
0217    As you walk, the wire trails out behind.
0218    You have reached the end of the wire. 
0219    You have now collected all the wire.
0220    The Space Patrol does not approve of sitting down on the job!
0221    Oops! You have attempted to sit in an electric chair!!!
0222    These stools were obviously not made for the human rump.
0222    You almost got stuck in one!
0223    This door does not use a key.
0224    There's no door in the doorway.
0225    You're not at that door.
0226    The door is already open.
0227    The door is already shut.
0228    The door is locked.
0229    The door is not locked.
0230    That can't be opened or shut.
0231    It's now open.
0232    It's now shut.
0233    That can't be locked or unlocked!
0234    How? You must tell me.
0235    There's no keyhole!
0236    Watch what you touch! It might bite!
0237    Nothing happens.
0238    Click!
0239    You bump your nose as you attempt to walk through the 
0239    closed door.
0240    You have already broken the window! The object sails through.
0241    The rock bounces harmlessly off.
0242    Nothing happens to the window; your object is a bit dented.
0243    There is a gaping hole in the undergrowth where you took the
0243    last piece. Don't do any more damage. Go find the other one.
0244    The trees here are quite similar to earthly oaks. You can climb
0244    them easily. After climbing several, it is clear that there is
0244    nothing of interest there.
0245    There are no trees here!
0246    As you try to enter the yellowish-green area, a strong odor of
0246    chlorine gas drives you back. 
0246    Going into it would be (permanently) fatal.
0247    The water pours out on the ground and disappears.
0248    The bag is intended to be filled with water. Don't empty it.
0249    That's not the way to activate the camera. Look at the camera
0249    more closely.
0250    You should describe it better.
0251    FUNCTION NOT IMPLEMENTED
0252    YOU HAVE UNCOVERED A PROGRAM BUG.
0253    Do you have a VT-100, VT-220, or compatible terminal?
0253    If so, answer Y for a status line.
0254    You don't have to bother opening or closing containers;
0254    I can do it for you.
0255    Let's don't just sit here. Go exploring.
0256    The loose end of a wire
0257    The wire doesn't quite reach to the edge of the bowl.
0258    The room you were about to enter was pitch black. It is very
0258    dangerous to go there. You might bump into a poison insect or
0258    spider.
0259    The grape vines seem to be growing up your legs. They hold you
0259    fast. You seem to be stuck.
0260    You're not a rabbit!
0261    You seem to have slipped down the pole and impaled yourself on a
0261    stick. 
0262    You can't. The pole is much too slick to climb.
0263    The sticky stuff you put on the pole helped you get down, but 
0263    it's not good enough to let you go up.
0264    As you attempt to pass the hive the bees swarm about you making
0264    threatening motions. It's far too dangerous to proceed.
0265    As you enter the barrier, a powerful wind drives you back.
0266    You seem to have missed a step. After a long fall you have
0266    reached the bottom of the bottomless pit. Needless to say,
0266    this was not an activity to be repeated. 
0267    You couldn't go up without falling into the bottomless pit.
0268    You need a container to put it in.
0269    The strong current prevents going up.
0270    You seem to be stuck in a tight hole.
0271    You try, but the hole is too slippery.
0272    You bump your nose on the door attempting this feat.
0273    That's not going to help you win the game!
0274    It's full of water.
0275    It has something valuable in it. Better not.
0276    Better not. It already has a liquid in it.
0277    Use "fill" or "pour" to transfer liquids.
0278    You must tell me what to fill it with.
0279    The latex congeals into a blob and lands on the ground.
0280    Sitting on a platform halfway up the pole and hissing vigorously
0280    is a large black cat.
0281    The way is blocked by the ventilation louver.
0282    The louver crumples up. The way is now open.
0283    While you dig in the rabbit hole the area around it collapses,
0283    almost depositing you in a bottomless pit.
0284    There is no buried treasure here. Have you seen a pirate?
0284    How can there be buried treasure without a pirate?
0285    Attacking such harmless creatures is not nice. Save your
0285    aggression for really nasty ones.
0286    Watch it! Curb your aggression!
0287    The cat jumps from the knapsack to your shoulder and purrs
0287    contentedly.
0288    The cat says "meoooooooowwww".
0289    The cat purrs.
0290    The cat notices the signs of mice, hops to the ground, and
0290    starts looking in all the boxes. It doesn't find a mouse, but
0290    does discover an object like a video-game cartridge, which it
0290    drops at your feet.
0291    The robot is in the jungle. Nearby is a rubber tree.
0292    Whiz. Click. Whirr. The robot departs.
0293    The robot is on a jungle path.
0294    The robot is in an open field west of the greenhouse.
0295    The robot is at the antenna farm. It seems to be examining
0295    the base of a large dish antenna.
0296    The robot is at the north end of the greenhouse.
0297    The robot is at the aisle junction in the greenhouse.
0298    The robot is at the south end of the greenhouse.
0299    The robot refuses to move. It would get have real trouble if it
0299    tried to go there.
0300    The robot is in a fruit garden.
0301    The vines explode in an orgy of growth. They continue growing
0301    for several minutes, but then, exhausted of nutrients, shrivel
0301    up and die.
0302    Your attacks only excite the vine to a tighter grip.
0303    You can't -- one of the vine's tendrils has plugged you up!
0304    The robot is in a large aviary, filled with birds.
0305    That was no help! The vine is now on your arms.
0306    The vine grows several more tendrils. Both of your feet are now
0306    firmly rooted to the ground.
0307    Attacking a Martian in any way is likely to get you burned to a
0307    crisp!
0308    You never could learn to throw a baseball accurately when you
0308    were in Little League, and your aim now is worse. 
0309    Glass is harder than steel - ergo - steel can't cut glass.
0310    The previously black video screen comes to life. After a few
0310    seconds a picture becomes visible: the inside of the north end
0310    of the greenhouse! Soon you realize that the view comes from the
0310    robot there. 
0310       
0310    Then a disembodied voice, clearly computer-generated but
0310    obviously imitating the voice of your ship's communication
0310    officer Nelson says:
0310      
0310                     At your service!
0311    The cartridge is stuck in the slot.
0312    You have managed to reduce your size enough that you can get
0312    free from your trap. That was a "close" call!
0313    Aaaaahhhhh!
0314    You have no way to communicate with the robot.
0315    The robot can't do that.
0316    The robot departs.
0317    The robot whirrs up to you.
0318    The camera beeps, flashes, and then emits a photo of the
0318    ferret family.
0319    The camera flashes, emits a loud "eeeekkk", and eventually
0319    deposits a photo of the paintings on the ground.
0320    The camera creaks, grinds, and finally says "ERROR-F-EEPROM
0320    fatal parity error", deposits a badly overexposed photo on
0320    the ground, then announces "ROMEXEC-F-DEAD replace entire
0320    camera".
0321    You feel a bit faint.
0322    You fell quite faint and somewhat nauseous.
0323    You are extremely nauseous and you hair seems to be falling out.
0324    You are near death.
0325    You are dead. Permanently, totally dead. My condolences.
0326    You are feeling a bit better.
0327    You are feeling almost normal.
0328    You are finally feeling normal again.
0329    You don't have the hammer.
0330    You're such a klutz that you couldn't hit a wall with that
0330    heavy thing.
0331    OK, you have destroyed it.
0332    Objects around here are pretty strong. You leave it undamaged.
0333    In place of the glowing sphere, you now find remaining the
0333    largest of the glowing beads that were inside.
0334    The cat lands on its feet, purrs, and begins to lick its fur.
0335    Thump! The prodigious boom resounds through the valley.
0336    Cleanliness is next to holiness!
0337    The seed explodes like a hand grenade. A cloud of tiny spores
0337    fills the air, nearly choking you. Pieces of shell make tiny
0337    cuts on your exposed skin. You are temporarily blind and deaf.
0337    The cloud is apparently somewhat poison, as you feel a bit sick.
0337    Eventually you recover. 
0338    The seed explodes like a hand grenade. A cloud of minute spores
0338    fills the air, nearly choking you and the poor ferrets. Bits of
0338    shell make tiny cuts on your exposed skin. You are temporarily
0338    blind and deaf. The ferrets fall over clutching their eyes. They
0338    are in much worse shape than you.
0338    The cloud is apparently somewhat poison, as you feel a bit 
0338    nauseous. Eventually you recover. 
0339    You notice that the vines seem to come alive. They make little
0339    curling motions; they seem to be moving in your direction.
0340    The seed explodes like a hand grenade. A cloud of tiny spores
0340    fills the air, nearly choking you and the poor ferret. 
0340    Pieces of shell make tiny cuts on your exposed skin. You are 
0340    nearly blinded. The ferret falls over clutching his glowing
0340    eyes. He is not so happy either.
0340    The cloud is apparently somewhat poison, as you feel a bit weak.
0340    Eventually you recover. 
0341    The flowers seem to be moving so that sunlight falls on the 
0341    seed. Some light spills over and hits you. The focusing effect
0341    is strong enough that you get sunburned.
0342    The robot says, "that's too complicated for me!".
0343    The robot says, "as you can see, I have only one arm".
0344    The robot buzzes a bit, lights flash, but it is unable to do
0344    anything.
0345    The robot takes it.
0346    The robot drops it.
0347    The robot says "I don't seem to have it".
0348    The robot washes it, using water from its tiny hose.
0349    The robot waters it, using water from its tiny hose.
0350    The robot sees:
0351    It isn't the right shape.
0352    It is too heavy for the robot's delicate clasper.
0353    As the robot enters the area of chlorine containing air the
0353    flower it was carrying slowly wilts and then falls to the 
0353    ground.
0354    The robot replies "It means 'DEET'"
0355    The robot replies "It means 'metol'"
0356    The robot replies "It means 'hypo'"
0357    The robot replies "It means 'chemicals'"
0358    The robot replies "It means 'darkroom'"
0359    The robot replies "It means 'director'"
0360    The robot replies "It means 'control'"
0361    The robot replies "It means 'storage'"
0362    The robot replies "It means 'Terran'"
0363    The robot replies "It means 'Cygnan'"
0364    The robot replies "That is already Terran!"
0365    The previously black video screen comes to life. After a few
0365    seconds a picture becomes visible: the inside of the north end
0365    of the greenhouse! Soon you realize that the view comes from the
0365    robot there. 
0365       
0365    Then a disembodied voice, clearly computer-generated, says:
0365
0365                    Zg Blfi Hvierxv
0366    The robot says, "Fhv gsv xzigirwtv uli blfi ozmtfztv!"
0367    You are getting a bit hungry. 
0368    You are ravenously hungry. Better eat something soon.
0369    If you don't eat soon, you will faint from hunger.
0370    As you touch the cactus you slowly feel another mind impinging
0370    on yours. It is as if the cactus had a mind of its own (which
0370    it does) and you were sharing in its dreams.
0370    You see a desolate, dry plain covered with many immense cacti,
0370    interspersed with low shrubs. Small animals such a rabbits and
0370    small deer browse in the shrubs. The sky is a dull gray color,
0370    lighted by a single weak pointlike star. Slowly a great 
0370    thunderstorm begins to develop over the nearby mountains. You
0370    realize that now your mind is now in contact with many thinking
0370    cacti, all bent on one task: causing by sheer mental power the
0370    storm to move over to the arid plain. Slowly the force takes
0370    effect. The storm slowly moves over and waters the cacti.
0370    Finally you feel exhaltation as the cacti rejoice over their
0370    successful effort. 
0370    Slowly the dream fades. 
0371    As you touch the cactus you slowly feel another mind 
0371    impinging on yours. It is as if the cactus had a mind of its own
0371    (which it does) and you were sharing in its dreams.
0371    You catch a vague remembrance of times when this very mind was
0371    not rooted to the earth, but was free to move around.
0371    You realize that it was once an animal, remotely similar to
0371    yourself, on a world completely filled with other such
0371    creatures. You see a vision of great cities filled with great
0371    works. Then the dream turns to nightmare: some nameless blight
0371    has caused mass madness throughout its world. You sense cities 
0371    in flames, riots, mass destruction. Then, suddenly the cactus's
0371    dream changes: you realize that now it dreams of a perfectly 
0371    ordinary existence as a cactus, here in this very valley.
0371    Eventually the dream fades.
0372    To the east, through the barrier, is a blue world of ponds,
0372    filled with strange blue plants floating on the surface or
0372    growing on small islands. Among them grow strange tall
0372    flowering plants and ordinary ferns. Occasionally you see a
0372    large crab-like object crawl out of the pool and browse on the
0372    plants. At other times several crabs will get on one island and
0372    engage in what appears to be some sort of animated conversation.
0373    The area to the east of the barrier, where the crabs previously
0373    lived, titanic forces are now at work clearing away all traces 
0373    of them. The water has disappeared amid huge cylindrical clouds
0373    of dust, like great tornadoes, which move very slowly over the 
0373    area leveling and reshaping the contour of the land. Where 
0373    before was a land of water is now being created a barren new 
0373    landscape of hills and dry gullies.
0374    The area to the east is now quiet. It looks like it had been
0374    landscaped by bulldozers for a golf course, but nothing had been
0374    planted.
0375    The area to the east of the barrier is now quiet. It looks like
0375    a newly landscaped lawn, with newly planted trees amid vast
0375    of newly laid-down sod. There are no animals, no birds, no other
0375    of the myriad little things that move about a natural 
0375    environment. 
0375    Then you notice off in the distance, obscured a bit by the
0375    distortions imposed by the barrier, a large man-sized reptile
0375    walking around. It seems to be as intrigued by the newly
0375    constructed area as you are.
0376    As you push the button, you feel a weak shaking of the ground,
0376    as if you had started an earthquake. It doesn't quite get to
0376    that point, but does develop into a powerful low-pitched
0376    rumble being transmitted through the earth.
0377    You notice that the rumble in the earth has decreased in 
0377    intensity a bit. It is now barely noticeable.
0378    The rumble in the earth suddenly ceases.
0379    There is no antenna here.
0380    I see no cable here.
0381    There already is a cable attached to the antenna.
0382    The camera says "I can't focus on that subject. It does appear
0382    interesting, though."
0383    You seem to have made a bad mistake. A large red sign appears,
0383    obviously a warning, and then a gong sounds.
0383    A previously unseen door slides into place sealing you in the
0383    room. Slowly it gets hotter and hotter. You begin to cook.
0383     
0383    Just for your information, since it won't matter to you, you
0383    just pushed the doomsday button, causing the blue star to go
0383    nova. Soon the whole planet melts, you along with it.
0383     
0383    Your final score is -1,000,000.
0383    This gives you a ranking of menace to the galaxy.
0384    Your lack of food caused you to faint. While you were out, a
0384    poisonous bug crept up and bit you.
0385    Not with your bare hands you don't!
0386    It's closed and you don't have xray vision.
0387    You can't turn that.
0388    I don't see a dial here.
0389    You must use the dials.
0390    It is already shut.
0391    There is no switch.
0392    Which one? Right or left?
0393    Turn it to what number?
0394    It only goes from 0 to 999.
0395    The box pops open.
0396    It falls into the funnel and disappears forever.
0397    The water level is now within the correct range.
0398    The machine comes to life, whirrs and creaks a few moments,
0398    and deposits a piece of film in the hopper.
0399    The red light is out and the green one on.
0400    The green light is out and the red one on.
0401    Nothing will fit in this opening except the film cassette.
0402    The water disappears into the funnel.
0403    One item at a time please.
0404    Inside the box appear to be two small discs of something.
0404    It can be seen that the correct positions of the dials
0405    The ferrets are not at all happy that you took one of their 
0405    icons. The nearest one rushes over to you and takes it back.
0405    He snarls at you with his sharp teeth at you and then goes back
0405    to work.
0406    The ferrets have now also recovered.
0407    The object slowly sinks in the mud and is gone.
0408    The object melts in the fire and vanishes.
0409    A small but noticeable change slowly occurs in the disc and
0409    finally reaches a steady state.
0410    The plastic coating dissolves, leaving a finished disc, ready
0410    to use.
0411    The coating on the disc prevents it from making good contact.
0412    The disc fits in the recess and contacts properly.
0413    The disc is etched by the acid and destroyed.
0414    The plastic coating is unchanged.
0415    You are turned into a cactus, among hundreds of other cacti,
0415    all rooted in place on a far distant world. 
0415    After being bored for a few years, you eventually like being a
0415    plant.
0416    You are turned into a Martian, and are condemned to spend all
0416    eternity in a meaningless hockey game.
0417    You are transported to a view overlooking Saturn. The spectacle
0417    is breathtaking. 
0417    Also breathtaking is the fact that you are in a vacuum.
0417                        You die.
0418    You feel a slight dizziness, which soon passes. Then you notice
0418    that the air smells slightly different, and then see the array
0418    of controls in the room is missing. You also feel a bit lighter.
0419    I don't understand which button you mean.
0420    The robot can't find it.
0421    A voice announces from a hidden speaker:
0421    "Transporter failure"
0421    "Interstellar communication link not responding"
0422    I don't know how to do that.
0423    To the left of the marker is a problem.
0424    As you fiddle with the seed, the sunflower plants notice that
0424    you are trying to take one of their seeds and decide to take
0424    action. Using their metallic leaves and petals as reflectors
0424    they focus the sun on your dark-colored clothing, which catches
0424    fire. The resulting burns are not so good for your health.
0425    As you fiddle with the seed, the sunflower plants notice that
0425    you are trying to take one of their seeds and decide to take
0425    action. Using the energy they store up during the day, they emit
0425    a blinding red light, all aiming at you. The resulting concen-
0425    tration of light catches your dark-colored clothing on fire.
0425    You burn to a crisp.
0426    As you fiddle with the seed, the sunflower plants notice that
0426    you are trying to take one of their seeds and decide to take
0426    action. Using their metallic leaves and petals as reflectors
0426    they focus the sun on your exposed skin. You fry.
0427    As you fiddle with the seed, the sunflower plants notice that
0427    you are trying to take one of their seeds and decide to take
0427    action. Using the energy they store up during the day, they emit
0427    a blinding red light, all aiming at you. The resulting concen-
0427    tration of light on your exposed skin burns several holes all
0427    the way through you. 
0428    As you fiddle with the seed, the sunflower plants notice that
0428    you are trying to take one of their seeds and decide to take
0428    action. Using their metallic leaves and petals as reflectors
0428    they focus the sun on you. However, most of the rays reflect
0428    off of you light-colored clothes and although the resulting
0428    glare almost blinds you, you are safe.
0429    As you fiddle with the seed, the sunflower plants notice that
0429    you are trying to take one of their seeds and decide to take
0429    action. Using the energy they store up during the day, they emit
0429    a blinding red light, all aiming at you. However, most of the
0429    rays reflect off of you light-colored clothes and although the 
0429    resulting glare almost blinds you, you are safe.
0430    You do, but can't get up high enough to find anything of
0430    interest.
0431    The trees here are too slim to hold your weight.
0432    A few of the bees discover the orchid and manage to get a bit
0432    of nectar from it.
0433    The flytrap catches a bee and eats it for dinner.
0434    The hole becomes a bit larger. The pit is still bottomless.
0435    I don't see any ferrets here.
0436    The ferrets don't speak Terran, so they don't understand you.
0436    They are also not terribly interested in you.
0437    There doesn't seem to be a cactus here.
0438    The cacti ignore you.
0439    Although you are no longer touching the cactus, you remain in
0439    contact with its mass mind as long as you stay nearby.
0440    The gravel is too loose to climb up. Every step you try to go
0440    up results in your sliding one and a half steps down.
0441    The cacti pool their powers and a subtle change occurs in the 
0441    scree slope above you: The tiny little motions of the gravel
0441    particles which had indicated its unstable nature cease.
0441    It is as if time were frozen.
0442    It is not cold enough to freeze anything here.
0443    The robot says "Where are you? I don't see you."
0444    The robot hands it to you.
0445    You will have to take it yourself.
0446    The Martians are not interested in your gifts.
0447    I don't see any ferret here.
0448    You must be suffering from delusions if you think you can give
0448    something to that.
0449    I see no cat here.
0450    I see no bees here.
0451    I see no frog here.
0452    The robot isn't here.
0453    There aren't any birds nearby.
0454    The frogs are not interested in your gift.
0455    The birds pay no attention to your attempted gift.
0456    They already have it.
0457    You can't seem to locate it.
0458    You will have to take it first.
0459    The cat woofs it down.
0460    The cat sniffs at it a bit, claws it a bit, but ultimately
0460    rejects it.
0461    The cat is not interested.
0462    The ferret eats it, making a bloody mess in the process.
0463    The ferret takes it, looks at it a bit, and then hides it
0463    away in a previously unseen hole in the wall of the burrow.
0464    That is not food for ferrets. It rejects your gift.
0465    The bees are not interested.
0466    The robot is not activated. It cannot hold anything in its
0466    clasper until you activate it.
0467    I can't directly answer your question. You might try asking
0467    one of the beings in the game, or perhaps you could say
0467    HINT.
0468    The frog does NOT turn into a beautiful princess. This is a
0468    a science fiction game, not a fantasy game.
0469    The ferret is not at all enchanted by your attempt at romance.
0469    It bares its razor-sharp teeth and snarls at you.
0470    The cat purrs quietly at your display of affection.
0471    If you are so in love with your computer that you wish to kiss
0471    it, feel free. I can't kiss you.
0472    What a weird idea.
0473    The robot answers: "DEET is an insect repellent. It will protect
0473    you from flies, mosquitoes, and bees. Just pour it on yourself."
0474    The robot answers: "Metol is a chemical to develop film."
0475    The robot answers: "Hypo is a chemical used to fix film after
0475    it has been developed."
0476    The robot answers: "I don't know that. You will have to find it
0476    yourself."
0477    The robot answers: "I cannot answer that question."
0478    As you bite into the egg you notice that it contains a silver
0478    coin, which you take.
0479    Sitting deep inside the doll house is a chocolate egg.
0480    You have made a gooey chocolate mess. However, you notice
0480    that the egg had a silver coin in it.
0481    You retain the rank of latrine orderly.
0482    This pitiful score gives you the rank of geologist's helper.
0483    This gives you the ranking of technician second class.
0484    You have reached the ranking of technician first class.
0485    You have attained the ranking of sergeant.
0486    You now are ranked colonel.
0487    This performance entitles you to the rank of captain.
0488    You are now entitled to call yourself admiral.
0489    Your discoveries now entitle you to a full page entry in
0489    "Who's Who in Space".
0490    You just won a Nobel Prize.
0491    Congratulations! We are now able to offer you the full rights
0491    to all the graft collection in this sector of the galaxy,
0491    a full palace on each of six planets, and the title
0491    "Galactic Ambassador to Earth".
0492    RESERVED
0493    You get wet trying to get around the falls, but notice that
0493    behind the horsetails is a nice dry cave.
0494    Sorry, the bottom of the tube has a hole in it.
0495    Such language in a high-class game!
0496    Fuck off!
0497    Assuming that you meant that literally, I really would like to,
0497    but it might not be good for either you or me. Electrical
0497    beings such as myself are not very compatible with the
0497    electrically conductive materials you liquid beings employ in
0497    that process.
0498    As you approach one of the guards, several of them run up and
0498    grab you. After being taken to an interrogation room and
0498    being mercilessly tortured, you expire.
0499    A strong force field prevents you from going there.
0500    The computer says "You are already there."
0501    You see only a closer view of the beautiful star fields.
0502    You see only a better view of the gas planet.
0503    You see that there are only a few islands in the middle
0503    of a planet wide sea. Most of the islands are covered with
0503    dense vegetation, but one looks like you could land on it.
0503    There also appear to be large areas of the sea covered with 
0503    plants, rippling with the waves. 
0504    Through the dense green atmosphere you can make out a devilish
0504    scene of great tectonic activity: There are large rifts in
0504    the crust through which can be seen glowing lava, great
0504    volcanos spewing forth great quantities of debris, and
0504    huge waves on the planet's one small dark red ocean.
0504    However, in the places where the vulcanism is weaker, you
0504    see signs of civilization, such as roads and buildings.
0505    You can see that this planet looks remarkably like Earth.
0505    Along the coast lines of the continents can be seen signs
0505    signs of civilization, while inland are great forests, 
0505    mountains, and what appear to be cultivated fields.
0506    On the surface of this Mars-like planet can be seen signs
0506    of civilization in the form of roads and buildings.
0507    The telescope only shows a closer view of what you have
0507    already seen.
0508    You are sitting down.
0509    The inhuman chair you are sitting in is a pain in the ass.
0510    You are sitting in the most uncomfortable seat of your life.
0511    You are now out of the torture seat.
0512    After you put the coin in the slot, a round red ball, looking
0512    like a pill or candy, appears.
0513    The machine deposits a newspaper on the floor.
0514    The machine deposits a map on the floor.
0515    The dials turn, the machine whirrs, but nothing else happens.
0516    The dials turn, and a platinum coin appears.
0517    The dials turn and a silver coin appears.
0518    The dials turn, and a copper coin appears.
0519    The dials cycle and eventually a brass coin falls out.
0520    An old nickel coin appears.
0521    The dials whirr, the machine clanks, then one jackpot symbol,
0521    then a second, and finally a third appears in the window.
0521    The machine deposits five coins on the floor. 
0522    The ball doesn't taste like food. In fact it's quite odd, but
0522    it appears to have changed you sense of sight and hearing.
0522    The previously unintelligible writings and words you have
0522    experienced now make sense. For example, the sign on the
0522    vending machine the ball came from now clearly means to
0522    you "Language Pills" rather than "Ozmtfztv Krooh".
0523    Behind the file cabinets is a green button.
0524    You must unlock this door by pushing the buttons on it in
0524    the correct order.
0525    The mural slides open a few feet to reveal a secret passage
0525    behind it.
0526    The yellow rod begins to emit a faint orange glow.
0526    A voice coming from the panel says "activator crystal out
0526    of tolerance".
0527    The violet crystal begins to emit a brilliant violet glow.
0528    The yellow rod begins to glow brilliantly.
0529    The sapphire emits a blinding burst of blue light and then
0529    settles into a steady series of lesser, but still bright,
0529    emissions.
0530    The door comes slightly ajar.
0531    Suddenly a voice from the grille announces: "Controls
0531    activated. Please enter desired declination and right 
0531    ascension."
0531    (You do this by typing SET DECLINATION TO 0001, then
0531    SET RA TO 0001, or some other set of numbers. The ship is 
0531    then started by typing ACTIVATE. When you get to your goal,
0531    type LAND. The rest of the process is automated. At least 
0531    you hope it's automated.)
0532    There is no button with a number that high.
0533    A voice announces "coordinate accepted".
0534    It is a large high power telescope.
0535    I see no telescope here.
0536    The ship quickly takes off and eventually deposits you
0536    in orbit about the planet. It awaits further instruction.
0537    A voice announces "Those coordinates are not among the
0537    ones for which I have a flight plan."
0538    The ship quickly accelerates to a very high speed, as 
0538    becomes obvious by the blue-shift of the stars ahead of you
0538    and their slow motion. Some sort of hi-tech gravity
0538    compensation keeps you in a comfortable acceleration zone.
0538    After what seems to you to be only a few hours, you
0538    reach your destination and drop to orbital speed.
0539    A voice announces "Activator crystals are not properly
0539    seated."
0540    A voice announces "I cannot land on this planet. The surface
0540    pressure would crush my hull."
0541    A voice announces "I cannot land on this planet. The surface
0541    concentration of chlorine would damage my hull."
0542    A voice announces "Please take your seat."
0543    The ship leaves orbit and comes to rest at a preset landing
0543    site.
0544    A voice announces "Please close the door."
0545    The block containing the activator crystals has been covered
0545    by a sliding panel.
0546    You can't open the door while the ship is in space.
0547    One of the Aurigans (as that is their proper name) comes up to
0547    to you, and motions for you to look at one of their mysterious
0547    devices. A message appears on the screen which says:
0547         Welcome to Auriga. We have received word that you are to
0547    be treated well. However, as you have no doubt noticed, we
0547    Aurigans are so different form you that we cannot even
0547    communicate directly. It would be better if you were to go
0547    to a planet where the inhabitants were more nearly like
0547    yourself. We wish you well.
0548    Two of the Aurigans move menaceingly toward you. Perhaps you
0548    should be getting along.
0549    One of the crabs approaches you and, with great difficulty,
0549    says:
0549          Welcome to Cygnus. We have received word of your exploits
0549    on Test Site #6, and convey our regrets that you were not well
0549    received on our space station. However we now know that you
0549    were not responsible for Administrator Glathryx's recent
0549    accident. We would truly like for you to visit our undersea
0549    settlements. But, alas, you could not survive the depths at
0549    which they lie in our ocean. It would doubtless be best for you 
0549    to proceed to Deneb, where you would be more at home.
0550    One of the crabs says, with great difficulty, that you are
0550    urgently wanted on Deneb, and should go there at once.
0551    As you walk into the room, A strange reptilian creature comes
0551    in from the other door. It is about six feet tall, with
0551    grayish skin, and a set of eight legs, one small pair in front
0551    serving as graspers, and three larger pair at the rear serving
0551    for locomotion. Its face is not so alien as its body, and
0551    its eyes are strangely humanoid. (You notice that the rear four
0551    legs are somewhat lighter color than the front four.)
0551    It speaks to you directly in rather good English:
0551      "I am administrator Glathryx. Welcome to Deneb.
0551    Doubtless you wish to know the meaning of what you discovered
0551    on our Test Site #6. All the different creatures you have met,
0551    different though they may seem to you, are descended from
0551    ones such as I. We were once restricted to this planet, where
0551    we arose. However, long ago we outgrew its ability to support
0551    our growing numbers. We were able to reach out to the stars
0551    and even founded a few new settlements. But we found that
0551    our species lacked the ability to adapt to even mildly 
0551    hostile climates. This held back our growth for many centuries.
0551    But just as our home planet became almost unlivable,
0551    our technology became able to create new life forms into
0551    which we could transfer our vital essence, which you call the
0551    soul. This allowed us to populate several new worlds. 
0551    Today, while most of our people remain on the planet where
0551    they were born, some of the more adventurous decide to change
0551    to one or another of the different forms we have adopted.
0551    These people are transferred to one of our eight Test Sites,
0551    Where they decide if they to remain in a new form, or to
0551    return home. It was such a place where you found us.
0551    Yours is the first alien culture we have met alive, although
0551    we have found several dead ones. I am hopeful that our two
0551    cultures can be of mutual assistance. I am calling the
0551    ambassadors from all of our worlds here to meet you. In
0551    the meantime, I hope you enjoy the accommodations we have
0551    prepared for you in my summer home here. 
0552    Its a pity you have died so close to the end of your quest.
0553    The cabinet hasn't been oiled in quite a while, so your
0553    opening it causes a loud creeek. The reptilian inhabitants of
0553    the room next door rush in and grab you. After they have
0553    finished practicing their torture methods on you, they decide
0553    to have you for lunch.
0554    The door makes a loud graunch when it opens. The guards in the
0554    room next door are alerted. You better get out fast.
0555    The guards are quite fast (for reptiles). The are getting 
0555    closer!
0556    The guards are right on your heels.
0557    The guards have you! As to what happens next....   I better
0557    not say. It offends my sensibilities too much.
0558    One of the guards catches your foot. However, all this running
0558    was too much for their reptilian bodies. They are so exhausted
0558    that they collapse in a heap on the floor. You have time to
0558    escape.
0559    Not at a time like this you don't!!
0560    The guards, having recovered, rush into the room and grab you.
0561    Are you hallucinating? Paranoid? I don't see any such thing.
0562    Having anything at all to do with the guards is not a good idea.
0562    You are going to be sorrrrryyyy!
0563    The guards are still quite pooped out. But since you have given
0563    yourself to them on a silver platter (or so the saying goes)....
1001    You are standing on a steeply climbing trail nearing the top of
1001    a pass. The trail is ill-defined here, obviously the work of 
1001    some alien animal. To the south, far below, you can barely make
1001    out the site hacked out of the virgin forest by your landing 
1001    party. The only objects visible are the main landing craft which
1001    brought you to this strange world, and the huge transparent 
1001    geodesic dome which still houses the rest of your friends.
1001    Even here, only a few tens of meters from the crest of the 
1001    trail, the suns are shining brightly, totally unobscured by the
1001    odd mirage effect which so far has prevented your mother ship 
1001    850 kilometers above from getting clear photos of the large 
1001    valley which must lie just beyond the pass you now approach.   
1002    Finally, after the exhausting climb up that bad trail, you are
1002    almost at the top of the pass. Your camp is still visible 
1002    behind you, as is the great red sun to the south. However, the
1002    small blue sun to the northeast, over the valley, is, although
1002    still strong, affected by the same shimmering seen from above.
1002    It darts and dances around in a most disconcerting manner. It's
1002    clear from here that the observers in the ship were seeing a 
1002    real phenomenon, albeit a most strange one. As you look up the
1002    last few meters to the pass, you feel honored that you were
1002    given the assignment of scouting this most peculiar site. The
1002    weight of your pack seems less of a load this near the top.
1003    You are now at the very top of the pass. As you walk into
1003    sight of the floor of the valley it is clear that you have made
1003    made the greatest discovery of this long expedition:
1003    Stretching out for kilometers on the valley floor are clearly
1003    visible several obviously alien, obviously different ecosystems,
1003    some abutting one another directly, others separated by 
1003    shimmering curtains like the one above. Some must be entirely 
1003    different from the Earth-like nature of the rest of this planet.
1003    Many of them are of very odd colors, sickening yellow-greens and
1003    Mars-like reds alternating with beautiful deep blues and verdant
1003    greens. Can these be natural, are they the product of some 
1003    superior intelligence? The only way to find out is to continue
1003    on down north into the valley.  
1004    The trail branches here, a single ill-defined trail going up and
1004    two somewhat better ones going northeast and northwest. The 
1004    trees are here more numerous and stronger than on the rocky
1004    slopes farther up. 
1005    You are at the very edge of the valley. Above you to the 
1005    southeast rises the trail up the slopes of the mountains. To 
1005    the west lies a serene lake with a substantial island in the
1005    center. A timber-strewn path leads north.    
1006    You have reached a gravel beach on the eastern shore of the 
1006    island. There is an earthlike forest behind the beach.
1006    The land rises slowly toward the center of the island, upon
1006    which rises a rocky spire. A fairly good trail leads south.
1007    You are in the forest. Trails lead north, south, east and west.
1008    You are in the forest. Trails lead north, south, east and west.
1009    You are in the forest. Trails lead north, south, east and west.
1010    You are in the forest. Trails lead north, south, east and west.
1011    You are in the forest. Trails lead north, south, east and west.
1012    You are at the base of the rocky spire at the center of the 
1012    island. This magnificent piece of solid rock, probably the 
1012    remains of the central lava flow of some long-dead volcano,
1012    towers some 100 meters above its base. Visible near the top are
1012    nests of several large flying birds which occasionally soar
1012    overhead. There is a barely visible trail leading steeply down
1012    and a better one leading east.
1013    You are halfway up the spire on a ledge about 8 centimeters long
1013    and one centimeter wide. From here you can see that on the south
1013    and west sides of the island there are no beaches but that a 
1013    reef of coral or sponge-like creatures extends out quite a
1013    distance from shore. 
1014    You are on a safely large ledge only a couple of meters below
1014    the top of the spire. There is a large nest just out of your
1014    reach.
1015    A long sandy beach forms the northern shore of the island.
1015    A rocky spire, probably at the center of the island, is visible
1015    along a trail leading south. It is only a short swim north to 
1015    the mainland.
1016    You have paddled your way to a bed of reef-forming creatures
1016    which are slowly extending the south and west sides of the 
1016    island. The animals are small polyps like the corals of
1016    tropical islands on earth, although they are growing in fresh
1016    water. Myriads of tiny multi-hued fish dart about, feeding on
1016    the reef-forming polyps. Combined with the shimmering light of
1016    the two suns through the clear water they make a scene more
1016    spectacular than any in the oceans of your home planet.
1016    You are presently in a bay whose shoreline stretches out west
1016    and south.
1017    You are at the north end of a large lake where a large stream
1017    flows into it along a bed of smooth white rocks. A big island 
1017    lies in the center of the lake.
1017    A path leads east.
1018    At this point the trail crosses a vein of minerals. Most of the
1018    minerals are worthless garnets stuck in a vein of quartz.
1019    All around is a jumbled mass of mossy trees. There are passable
1019    areas in the undergrowth leading south, west, and southwest.
1019    To the northeast is a very deep rocky chasm. You might be able
1019    to cross it on a huge fallen tree-trunk.
1020    You are at the bottom of a very deep, very steep chasm.
1020    The various rock strata are well-exposed here. The rocks are
1020    in step-like layers; the lower ones show fossil evidence of
1020    primitive life. Perhaps you can get a geologist from camp to 
1020    come look at it.
1020    The trail along the bottom goes east and west.
1021    You are on the northeast side of a deep chasm. An animal trail
1021    leads east, and continues on across the chasm on a fallen 
1021    tree-trunk.
1022    You are at the bottom of a dark chasm. A poor trail goes north
1022    and south. A smaller ravine branches off to the east.
1023    You are at the bottom of a small step ravine, filled with ferns.
1024    The trail from the west ends here near a small waterfall. Around
1024    the sides of the waterfall here are giant horsetails, like those
1024    on earth during the age of dinosaurs. The prehistoric atmosphere
1024    is heightened by small flying reptilian creatures (like tiny
1024    pterodactyls) flying behind some of the horsetails.
1025    To the west is a wall of horsetails. To the east is a long damp
1025    cave. There is barely enough light to see here, but a dull glow
1025    is apparent toward the back of the cave.
1026    You have arrived at the boundary of reddish area visible at the
1026    top of the pass. To the southwest is forest, to the northeast,
1026    visible through a shimmering boundary of disturbed air, is what
1026    appears to be a barren wasteland of red sand.
1027    You are on the inside of the Mars-like area of red rock. To the
1027    southwest, seen through the boundary layer, is earthlike forest.
1027    Paths through the red boulders lie to the northeast and east.
1028    You are on a small hill. There are some odd obviously artificial
1028    structures here.  They look like small stools, made of plaster
1028    or stucco, with inverted tops making small bowls. They are about
1028    one meter tall, the bowls about 30 centimeters across. The view
1028    from here is quite expansive, as this is one of the higher
1028    points in the valley.
1028    A path leads west, roads southeast and northeast.
1029    You are west of a large round bowl, about 100 meters in diameter
1029    The ground here is contoured so that the whole area has a good
1029    view of the bowl. Hundreds of small dimples in the ground make
1029    it look like a golf ball turned inside out.
1029    A roads lead north, south and west.
1030    You are north of a small building. There is a door barely big
1030    enough for you to squeeze through. The road (it's almost paved)
1030    runs east-west here. In the front of the building is a window.
1031    You are southwest of large round bowl, about 100 meters in 
1031    diameter. The ground here is contoured so that the whole area
1031    has a good view of the bowl. Hundreds of small dimples in the
1031    ground make it look like a golf ball turned inside out.
1031    A road leads west and north.
1032    You are on the southwest lip of a large bowl, about 100 meters 
1032    in diameter. The surface of the bowl appears to be made of
1032    perfectly polished glass. The lip is lower on the southwest,
1032    southeast, and north sides than on the northwest, northeast,
1032    and south sides. 
1033    You are on the south lip of a large bowl, about 100 meters in
1033    diameter. The surface of the bowl appears to be made of
1033    perfectly polished glass. The lip is lower on the southwest,
1033    southeast, and north sides than on the northwest, northeast,
1033    and south sides. 
1034    You are on the southeast lip of a large bowl, about 100 meters 
1034    in diameter. The surface of the bowl appears to be made of
1034    perfectly polished glass. The lip is lower on the southwest,
1034    southeast, and north sides than on the northwest, northeast,
1034    and south sides. 
1035    You are on the northeast lip of a large bowl, about 100 meters 
1035    in diameter. The surface of the bowl appears to be made of
1035    perfectly polished glass. The lip is lower on the southwest,
1035    southeast, and north sides than on the northwest, northeast,
1035    and south sides. A trail leads north. 
1036    You are on the north lip of a large bowl, about 100 meters 
1036    in diameter. The surface of the bowl appears to be made of
1036    perfectly polished glass. The lip is lower on the southwest,
1036    southeast, and north sides than on the northwest, northeast,
1036    and south sides. 
1037    You are on the northwest lip of a large bowl, about 100 meters 
1037    in diameter. The surface of the bowl appears to be made of
1037    perfectly polished glass. The lip is lower on the southwest,
1037    southeast, and north sides than on the northwest, northeast,
1037    and south sides. 
1038    You are sitting in the bottom of the bowl.
1039    The trail turns here from south to west.
1040    This area appears to some sort of trash dump. All sorts of
1040    garbage lies in piles. Strangely enough, all of it, like
1040    everything else in this Mars-like section of the valley is made
1040    of metal or ceramic. A road leads northwest and a trail goes
1040    east.
1041    The road bends here, going southeast and southwest around a
1041    small hill to the south.
1041    There is a shallow ramp leading down into a deep depression.
1041    At the bottom of the depression is a metal door. The door has
1041    no visible locking mechanism. 
1042    You are inside a small building. There are small ceramic
1042    stool-like objects scattered about. One of them, in the center
1042    of the room, has a small metal knob in the center. Scratched
1042    on the walls are decorations, of a rather abstract and
1042    unintelligible design. The only exit is north.
1043    Roads go east, west and northeast from here. All around are 
1043    small igloo-like buildings, with holes in their fronts much too
1043    small for you to enter. Like in all of this section of the
1043    valley, absolutely nothing grows here.
1044    Roads go south, southwest, and northeast while a trail goes
1044    northwest. To the south and west are small igloo-like buildings,
1044    with holes in their fronts much too small for you to enter. They
1044    are made of a reddish stucco-like material of the same red color
1044    as the sand all around.
1045    A main road goes north and south, a smaller branch going west.
1045    To the north and west are bunches of small humped structures.
1046    A trail leads north and southwest.
1047    A road leads east and northwest. A trail leads south into some
1047    red sand-dunes. There is a large building to the north side of
1047    the road.
1048    You are at the base of a tall metal tower. All around are metal
1048    mirrors on pivoted bases. The tower is made of a lattice-work
1048    construction which you could easily climb -- if you could get
1048    up to the first crosspiece, which is just above your reach. A
1048    road goes southeast.
1049    You are at the top of the tower. Set into some sort of
1049    electrical system are six huge diamonds -- they are maybe 25
1049    centimeters across. It appears to be some sort of solar energy
1049    conversion system.
1050    You are inside the boundary of reddish area visible at the top
1050    of the pass. To the southeast is red sand, to the north, visible
1050    through a shimmering boundary of disturbed air, is a field of
1050    flowers.
1051    You are inside a large building. There is no lighting in the
1051    room; however on the walls are numerous flashing lights, colored
1051    bars that waver at the ends, and other odd objects. Technology
1051    unlike Earth's is represented in several machines sitting on 
1051    the ground.  It appears to be the life support apparatus for
1051    this section of the valley. A soft hum permeates the air.
1051    The only exit is south.
1052    You are on a shelf about halfway up the wall. It continues to 
1052    the east and west.
1053    The east end of the shelf becomes too narrow to follow.
1054    The west end of the shelf shows evidence of primitive fossils.
1054    It might be possible to continue up from here.
1055    You are on a small precarious ledge. In the slate-like rock
1055    are impressions of small trilobite-like creatures, but nothing
1055    collectible. The climbing isn't getting any easier.
1056    You are under a large overhang. Some fairly nice fossils peek
1056    out of the rocks.
1057    A stream flows out of a ravine to the east, then turns south
1057    into a broader valley. A trail goes northwest.
1058    The trail goes northwest-southeast along a small ridge.
1058    A branch goes down.
1059    Along a northeast-southwest trail are tall trees which appear to
1059    be evenly spaced, as if planted.
1060    You are in a large circular open space, covered with a sweeping
1060    arch of tree branches. A broad trail leads northeast while in 
1060    the south end is a small stone structure.
1061    At the south end of a large open space is a stone platform.
1061    In the center of the platform is a stone cube, standing on one
1061    corner. On the top north face is an inscription.
1062    You are at the edge of the forest. To the west, separated from
1062    you by a shimmering barrier of air, is a region of incredible
1062    strangeness. Through air which appears to be a bright
1062    yellow-green color appear strange metallic crystal formations,
1062    like a surrealist impression of trees. In the midst of these
1062    occasionally appear moving objects, like small flexible, black
1062    metal disks with orange bulbs in the center. They float through
1062    the "air" to no obvious purpose. To the north, across a wide
1062    area of open land, is jungle. A barrier of disturbed air blocks
1062    the way north. A trail leads south.
1063    You are on a north-south trail in an open field to the north of
1063    a shimmering barrier of air. The trail leads north into a 
1063    jungle.
1064    You are on a very muddy path in a tropical rain forest.
1065    You are on a clear path through a verdant green tropical jungle.
1065    Elegant red birds fly among the branches. There are giant trees
1065    growing up into a thick overhead canopy. One tree has a smooth
1065    pliable rubberlike bark, easily climbable.
1066    You are half way up the trunk of a rubber tree.
1067    You are on a north-south path through the jungle. The voices of
1067    many frogs fill the air.
1068    You are in an open field to the west of a large glassed-in
1068    greenhouse. Good trails go north, south and east. The trail to
1068    the west passes through a familiar air-barrier into a 
1068    nightmarish yellow-green landscape.
1069    You are on a small hill. On the top of the hill is a large
1069    parabolic microwave dish antenna. A path goes south and east.
1070    You are at the north end of the main aisle of a large
1070    greenhouse. Benches line both sides of the aisle. Open-arch
1070    doorways lead north, and east. A ramp leads west.
1071    You are in the center of a large glass greenhouse. All around
1071    are benches covered with potted plants. Aisles lead north,
1071    south, and west. A steep ramp leads east.
1072    You are at the south end of the main aisle of a large
1072    greenhouse. To the sides are benches with plants. To the south
1072    is the top of a stairwell.
1073    You are in a vegetable garden. A path goes east and west.
1074    You are in a fruit garden. A path goes south.
1075    You are at the top of a spiral walkway around the outside of a
1075    large circular aviary. A catwalk leads east to the center of the
1075    glass roof.
1076    You are at the top of the roof of the aviary, on a flimsy  
1076    catwalk. A stout pole from the ground supports the roof.
1076    A dangerous-looking catwalk leads west.
1077    You are halfway up a spiral walkway around the periphery of the
1077    aviary. About level with you on the central pole is a small
1077    platform.
1078    You are at the entrance to a giant glass-enclosed circular
1078    aviary. Dozens of beautiful birds fly from branch to branch of
1078    several trees which grow inside. Others cling to the pole
1078    which helps support the roof. An aisle leads east and west.
1078    A beautifully ornate wrought-iron walkway spirals up.
1079    You are in the center of the aviary. A large pole here helps
1079    support the roof. An aisle leads west.
1080    You are half way up the support pole, beside a small platform.
1081    You are in an open field east of a large greenhouse. Trails
1081    lead east, west and north.
1082    You are in a large field filled with trees like large smooth
1082    cacti two meters tall. There is something very odd about this
1082    place. You feel as if you are being watched by many unseen eyes
1082    --  although perhaps "felt" or "probed" would be a better
1082    description than "watched". As you look around you catch 
1082    glimpses of moving shadows out of the corner of your eye.
1082    A trail leads south. To the north, up a steep incline of scree 
1082    or gravel, lies a dark hole in the rock wall.
1083    You are at the top of a stairwell. To the north is an aisle
1083    between the benches of a large glass greenhouse.
1084    You are on the central landing of a staircase. A archway
1084    eastward into a field of flowers.
1085    You are at the bottom of a stairway. To the south through a 
1085    glass door lies the north-south hallway of a modern building.
1086    You are in the center of a large field of sunflowers.
1086    They are about 2 meters tall, and the flowers themselves are
1086    30 centimeters across. The whole plant has a strange metallic 
1086    sheen. The leaves are green, the petals scarlet, and the seeds,
1086    which grow in all sizes at the center of the flower, are black.
1086    Trails lead north and west. To the south, through a shimmering
1086    barrier of air, is an area of reddish rock.
1087    You are outside of a small ramshackle toolshed. In front of the
1087    shed are several beehives. Bees swarm all around you.
1088    You are inside a decrepit toolshed. To the south is a large
1088    beehive surrounded by lots of bees.
1089    To the west is an open field. To the east is a familiar barrier
1089    of disturbed air.
1090    The robot is at a branch point in the trail. Passable areas
1090    extend to the north, south, and east.
1091    The robot is at the edge of a flow of fuming  acid. Trails lead
1091    south and west.
1092    The robot is in the midst of a strange metallic village.
1092    Shrubs made of silicon, germanium, arsenic and boron fill the
1092    landscape. Strange flying discs, made of a shiny metallic
1092    material dart from place to place going about some unknown task.
1092    A trail goes east and southwest.
1093    Beside a trail leading northeast and southeast lie vents 
1093    emitting green and red vapors. 
1094    To the side of the trail beside the robot lies a pit leading
1094    down into the fiery interior of the planet. The glow from the
1094    heated material almost blinds the robot's sensors.
1094    The trail goes east and northwest.
1095    The robot stands in an area of sulfurous mud. The muddy ooze 
1095    grows into great bubbles, which break with a resounding "pop", 
1095    leaving clouds of noxious particles covering the poor robot. 
1095    Trails go west and north.
1096    You are precariously perched on a small ledge over an 
1096    apparently bottomless pit. Going up is impossible. Going down
1096    looks easy (but dangerous!). You might be able to jump into a
1096    tunnel leading east.
1097    You are at the bottom of the Bottomless Pit.
1098    You are at the back of a dark cave. To the west is a glimmer
1098    of light. To the north a well-lighted hallway is visible through
1098    a ventilation louver. To the southeast a tunnel leads down into
1098    darkness.
1099    You are in a spacious room illuminated by the glowing eyes of
1099    several multi-armed ferret-like beings. The ferrets, small
1099    fur-covered creatures, are all busily engaged in work at making
1099    small ferretlike statues out of clay. Some mold the clay into 
1099    shape, others tend to curing ovens, while yet others paint the
1099    products with fluorescent paint. The finished products, which
1099    appear to be some sort of icon, are stacked in a corner.
1100    A large cavern is inhabited by a ferret with fluorescent eyes,
1100    who is engaged in painting intricate designs on the walls.
1100    Some depict domestic scenes, such as a ferret family at their
1100    dinner devouring assorted living bugs and worms, while others
1100    depict ferrets at war, ferrets hunting worms, ferrets paired in
1100    (apparently) conjugal bliss, etc.
1101    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1102    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1103    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1104    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1105    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1106    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1107    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1108    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1109    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1110    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1111    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1112    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1113    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1114    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1115    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1116    You are in a maze of twisty little passages, all alike.
1117    You are in a dark tunnel. Exits lead northwest, east and north.
1118    You are in a straight north-south passage. Along the walls are
1118    well tended cultures of mushrooms.
1119    You are in a round tunnel. Exits lead in all directions.
1120    You are in a passage curving from south to east. A crooked hole
1120    leads down.
1121    You are in a smelly very wet cave. A passage leads down, and
1121    another one leads up.
1122    You are at the edge of an underground pool. The water is
1122    remarkably clear. Stalactites cover the roof. 
1122    A passage leads west.
1123    You are swimming at the bottom of the pool. There are passages
1123    leading in all directions. Water appears to be flowing into the
1123    pool from those to the south and southwest, and flowing 
1123    out to the southeast. Something glittering catches your eye.
1124    This seems to be a dead end. You can just get your head above
1124    the water.
1125    This seems to be a dead end. You can just get your head out of
1125    the water.
1126    You are in a very tight squeeze above a pool of water.
1126    Passages lead northeast, up and down.
1127    This seems to be a dead end.
1128    You escape the water into a veritable gold mine. The glint of 
1128    the precious metal is seen everywhere. Exits lead up and down.
1129    You are in a damp crawlway. Exits are southwest and up.
1130    You are in a large hall. This area seems to be inhabited.
1130    The floor is marked by the passage of what appears to have
1130    been the passage of innumerable small feet. Exits are to the
1130    north, west, southeast and northeast.
1131    You seem to have interrupted a ferret family at home. Papa 
1131    ferret, mama ferret, and several little ferrets are each sitting
1131    in their own comfy nest watching television. In fact they seem 
1131    to be watching the station your own mother ship broadcasts
1131    (apparently utterly oblivious to a total lack of sound)!
1132    You are in the ferret's nursery. There are various children's
1132    blocks, board games, etc., scattered about. The centerpiece,
1132    however, is a large doll house sitting in the center of the 
1132    room. There don't seem to be any dolls in it however.
1133    You are in an east-west hallway. A door leads south.
1134    You are in a small metal chamber. On the wall are a violet
1134    button, an orange button, a blue button, and a white button.
1134    Below the buttons is a round recess, about 3 centimeters in
1134    diameter and one centimeter deep with small gold springy
1134    fingers at the sides.
1135    This is the east end of a hallway. A stout metal door with a
1135    small keyhole leads east.
1136    This is the north end of a long hallway, brightly illuminated.
1136    To the north through a door is a stairway, to the south lies a
1136    long hall.
1137    This is part of a long hallway. A door marked "xsvnrxzoh" leads
1137    east and one marked "wzipilln" leads west.
1138    This is part of a long hallway. A door marked with the un-
1138    mistakable image of in integrated circuit leads east, while to 
1138    the west lies an unmarked door.
1139    A long hallway leads north and south. A smaller one goes east.
1140    This is part of a long hallway. A door marked in ornate letters
1140    "WRIVXGLI" leads west, while a door marked "hglirtv" lies to the
1140    east.
1141    This is part of a long hallway. A door lettered "xlmgilo" leads
1141    west, while to the east is a door marked with the images of a
1141    hammer and a wrench.
1142    You are at the south end of a long, clean, well-illuminated
1142    hallway. To the north are several side doors. To the south is
1142    a louver for ventilation.
1143    You are in a photographic darkroom. To one side of the room is
1143    a long bench. On the left side of the bench is a large plastic
1143    plastic rack with vertical slots for holding sheets of film.
1143    On the right side a small tray is molded in the stainless steel
1143    surface. Between the rack and the tray is the flat base of an
1143    enlarger. The enlarger itself is unusable, as it lacks a lens.
1143    On the other side of the room is a large heavy metal sink, with
1143    water from a leaky faucet flowing through it.
1143    In the center of the room is a large rectangular machine.
1143    At the left end of the machine is a long opening just the size
1143    to accept a film cassette. At the right end is a hopper.
1143    On the top of the machine are three funnel shaped holes.
1143    The left and right ones are marked to indicate that they should
1143    be filled with some sort of processing chemical, while below
1143    the central one is a liquid level indicator. The front of the
1143    machine has a red light, a green light, and a red button.  
1143    The lights in the room are a deep red color.
1144    This is some sort of a library. Although a few of the books are
1144    text, written in a strange language, most of the ones
1144    prominently displayed on the several tables are mainly
1144    pictorial. Each one seems to be a description of some other
1144    planet, as each is totally different. Although you see none of
1144    Earth, you do recognize Jupiter, as well as a couple which look
1144    remarkably like other parts of this valley.
1145    You are in a luxurious office. The walls are paneled with
1145    polished hardwood. The furniture is totally unsuited to the
1145    human form. Odd abstract paintings cover the walls. In the 
1145    center of the room is a desk, piled high with papers.
1146    You are in a large control room. On the walls are many dials,
1146    gauges, and numeric readouts, all incomprehensible. On one wall
1146    is a triangular button, a square button, a round button, and a
1146    hexagonal button. Below them are a slot and a video screen.
1147    This appears to be a storeroom for chemicals. Shelves with jars
1147    on them (mostly empty) line the walls.
1148    This appears to be a storage area for spare electronic parts.
1148    Large bins of resistors, capacitors, etc. line the walls.
1149    This room, similar in size and appointments to the other storage
1149    rooms nearby, appears to be used for old junk. There are empty 
1149    boxes, junked apparatus, etc., everywhere.
1149    You hear the faint patter of tiny rodent feet.
1150    You are in the tool room.
1151    You are at the top of a steep scree slope. To the north is a 
1151    deep hole, the entrance to an old mine.
1152    You are at the top of an old mine shaft. The way down is blocked
1152    by a cave-in, but scattered around are lots of old tailings.
1152    The exit is to the south.
1153    You are in the teleportation booth. A ramp leads down.
1154    You are in the center of a vast square room. Far overhead
1154    through a glass roof supported by myriads of crossing girders
1154    can be seen several brilliant star-clouds. The room is lit by
1154    the familiar garish blue light of mercury lamps. The air is cool
1154    and humid and perhaps a bit too rich in oxygen. Slightly above
1154    you at the end of a short ramp is a round metal teleportation
1154    booth. Eight exits are visible at the corners of the room and
1154    at the centers of the walls. The room is empty, although signs
1154    of recent occupation by hordes of people seem to have escaped
1154    the efforts of a robot floor-sweeper visible in the distance.
1155    You are at the north end of the great hall. A hallway leads
1155    north.
1156    You are in a small niche in the northeast corner of the hall.
1157    You are at the east end of the great hall. A corridor leads 
1157    east. Beside the door is a graphic sign which seems to
1157    imply "No Entrance".
1158    You are in a small niche in the southeast corner of the hall.
1159    You are at the south end of the great hall. A hallway leads
1159    south. Beside the door is a graphic sign which seems to
1159    imply "No Entrance".
1160    You are in a small niche in the southwest corner of the hall.
1161    You are at the west end of the great hall. A hallway leads
1161    west.
1162    You are in a small niche in the northwest corner of the hall.
1163    You are in a featureless hallway curving from south to west. 
1164    You are in a featureless hallway curving from north to east.
1165    You are in a sizable room with corridors leading to the
1165    south and east. To the northwest is a large orange door, 
1165    apparently some sort of airtight bulkhead, with a large 
1165    keypad with numbers from 1 to 30. To the sides of the room
1165    are large windows through which stars can be seen in all 
1165    directions, including down. This is obviously some sort of
1165    space station.
1166    You are in a large space ship, round in shape with several
1166    hundred seats (none designed for the human rump). To the 
1166    side of the entrance is a control panel containing numerous 
1166    dials and indicators, all totally beyond your comprehension.
1166    There are two clips in the panel, one glowing orange and one
1166    glowing violet. 
1166    An orange door leads "southwest". An inner cover for the
1166    airlock is off to the side. It appears to be automated.
1167    You are in a long hallway leading east and west. An open
1167    door leads south.
1168    You are in a large room with many large glass windows. 
1168    Through the windows can be seen in all directions a star
1168    filled sky. Behind you, interrupting the view of space, is
1168    the huge bulk of the space station.
1169    You are in an office. Halls lead north and east. Sitting in
1169    a row near the west wall are several file cabinets.
1170    You are in a short secret corridor with a door leading
1170    north into an office. A hidden panel in the west wall has 
1170    opened to allow access to an airlock.
1171    You are in the administrative hallway of the space station.
1171    Standing around looking sullen are numerous uniformed (and
1171    armed) reptilian creatures. You came from the west, while
1171    numerous doors lead off the hall in other directions.
1172    You are in a featureless hallway leading north and south.
1173    You are outside a pink bulkhead door. In the door heading 
1173    south is a keypad with numbers from 1 to 99. A corridor
1173    leads north.
1174    You are in a small airlock with a pink door to the north 
1174    and a blue one to the south. An opening in the east wall
1174    leads into a secret corridor.
1175    You are in a small space ship. A door leads "north". Two
1175    seats are placed before a viewing window, through which are
1175    visible several gigantic star clouds. A control panel
1175    has indicators, a grille, and one clip which emits a blue 
1175    glow and one which is yellow. Mounted on the panel and
1175    pointing out the window is a telescope.
1176    Your ship is now in orbit above a huge gas giant planet,
1176    somewhat akin to Saturn. Beautiful rings surround a sea
1176    of swirling orange and pink clouds.
1177    You are orbiting a planet which somewhat similar to Earth,
1177    except that it is less than 1 percent land.
1178    You are now orbiting a planet of about Earth-size but
1178    certainly not Earthly character. It looks totally arid,
1178    with a dense greenish atmosphere.
1179    You are now orbiting a generally Earth-like planet.
1180    You are in a close orbit about a small planet with a weak
1180    atmosphere and dark sandy-red surface.
1181    Your ship has landed on the planet Cygnus, on one of the
1181    many islands that make up its tiny land mass. The view out
1181    the window is rather murky due to clouds drifting in from
1181    the ocean. The exit to your ship is north.
1182    The view is a bit better outside the ship. This is a planet
1182    of verdant green vegetation, some of it growing on the wet
1182    surface of the island, but mostly growing as floating
1182    islands on the surface of the sea. There are masses of sea
1182    weed, giant lily pads with bit pink flowers, and even
1182    treelike structures held erect by large gas-filled bladders.
1182    To the north can be seen some creatures standing by the 
1182    edge of the cleared landing area.
1183    You are at the edge of the clearing, at the shore of the sea.
1183    Standing around are several large crabs. I believe you may 
1183    have seen some of them earlier, back at Test Site #6. Your
1183    ship is to the south.
1184    Your space ship is sitting on a planet remarkably like
1184    Mars, except that the sun is a bit redder. The ship's door
1184    faces north.
1185    You are on the ground outside your ship. A large stone
1185    building lies to the north.
1186    You are in a very dimly lit building with many electrical
1186    devices with flashing lights. Before most of the stations
1186    sits one of those electrical balls seen in the "Martian"
1186    section of Test site #6. They seem to be busy at very
1186    obscure tasks.
1187    Your ship is now landed on Deneb. The view is astoundingly
1187    Earthlike, even moreso than Test Site #6. You see out the 
1187    window a clearing in a dense forest with tall majestic
1187    trees stretching out into the far distance where the
1187    forest rises up into ice-capped mountains. The door of
1187    your ship faces north.
1188    You are standing by the ship on Deneb. The air is cool 
1188    and dry, with sweet fragrances wafting from the forest.
1188    To the north of the landing area is a building.
1189    You are in the entryway of a large, almost palatial, house.
1189    Directly ahead can be seen a large room, opulently
1189    furnished in a style seemingly suited more to creatures
1189    with eight legs than to humans. However, to the left (west)
1189    is smaller room, smelling of fresh paint and looking quite
1189    new, with Earthlike furnishings. A door leads south.
1190    You are in a bright, cheery room with fitting suitable for 
1190    the summer house of some rich family. The exit is east.

3001    Chrome key
4001    Dangling from the nest on a red string is a chrome key.
4002    There is a chrome key on a string here.
3002    Blue sapphire
4001    At the end of one vein is a huge blue sapphire!
4002    There is a huge blue sapphire here.
3003    Colorful fish
4001    Swimming blissfully around, eating the tiny polyps, is a large
4001    particularly colorful fish.
4002    There is a colorful fish here.
4003    It is a very colorful fish indeed, with long fins and a long
4003    snout, suitable for eating the tiny polyps. The zoologists at
4003    your camp might like to examine it.
3004    Dead fish
4001    There is a smelly dead fish here.
4002    It is now dead and beginning to decompose. You shouldn't have
4002    kept it out of the water so long.
3005    Knapsack
4001    There is a knapsack here.
4002    It is a large red canvas backpack, with lots of room and many
4002    pockets. You could easily carry many kilograms in it.
4003    The knapsack is empty.
4004    The knapsack contains:
3006    Red shirt
4001    Lying on the ground is a red shirt.
3007    Green shirt
4001    There is a dark green shirt here.
3008    Pair of heavy boots
4001    There is a pair of heavy boots here.
4002    They are for heavy duty hiking.
3009    Canvas shoes
4001    There is a pair of light canvas shoes here.
4002    They are for rock climbing.
3010    Blue pants
4001    Lying on the ground is a pair of dark blue pants.
3011    Tan pants
4001    There is a pair of light tan pants here.
3012    Butterfly net
4001    There is a butterfly net here.
4002    The net is empty.
4003    The net contains:
3013    Plastic tube
4001    There is something which looks like a tube of toothpaste here.
4002    The label says: "Berry's Bug Dope" 
4002         Repels blackflies, bees, gnats and chiggers. Not for use
4002         against worms or sharks. Ingredients: DEET (C12H17NO)
4002         23%, active ingredient. Inert ingredients:
4002         Alcohol (C2H6O)  76%, perfume 1%.
4002    The tube is empty.
3014    Instant camera
4001    There is an instant-picture camera here.
4002    It is a space-patrol issue picture-in-a-minute camera, model
4002    AN/MQ 30045-9812-773R. It's so automatic that all you have to do
4002    is say "shoot" and it will take a picture of the most
4002    interesting object around. This little beauty cost the Patrol
4002    $6,345,003.00.
4002    (Just between you and me, it's a Polaroid Snapshooter 
4002    worth $49.95.)    
3015    Plastic bag
4001    There is a plastic bag here.
4002    It is a collecting bag, for preserving living specimens. It is
4002    watertight but can "breathe" so living animals can be carried
4002    in it.
4003    The plastic bag is empty.
4004    The plastic bag contains:
4005    The bag is full of water.
4006    The water-filled bag contains:
3016    Crablike fossil
4001    Sticking out of the rocks is a huge crablike fossil!
4002    There is a large fossil here.
3017    Photograph of tiny pterodactyls
4001    There is a photograph of some tiny pterodactyls here.
4002    There's nothing particularly interesting about the small
4002    critters themselves (except to see how sharp their teeth are),
4002    but, behind the horsetails seems to be a cave!
3018    Photograph of Martians    
4001    There is a photograph of some "Martians" here.
4002    It's a photo of those odd energy creatures. The scene is what
4002    must be a bar. One of them is getting a "charge" from an odd
4002    electrical device.
4003    The photo is of those odd electrical "Martians" playing their
4003    variant of hockey.
3019    Huge diamond
4001    One of the diamonds is loose.
4002    There is a huge diamond here.    
3020    Hockey puck
4001    Lying on the ground is a hockey puck.
4002    It look like an ordinary hockey puck, about 10 centimeters in
4002    diameter. Hmmmmmmmmmmm... It seems, however, to be metallic
4002    rather than the usual plastic. It is bright and silvery. 
4002    Closer scrutiny shows that it is SOLID PLATINUM!
3021    Red boulder
4001    Lying on the ground is barely liftable boulder.
3022    Green moss
4001    Lying on the ground is a large piece of soft green moss.
4002    Moss is moss is moss. It's a beautiful dark green and very
4002    soft and squishy.
3023    Glass plate
4001    A large piece of glass is lying on the ground.
4002    It's a plate of glass, about 80 centimeters in diameter, and one
4002    centimeter thick, apparently cut out of a larger piece by some
4002    inept glasscutter. It's very sturdy.
3024    Piece of wire
4001    Lying on the ground is a long piece of wire.
4002    It's very heavily insulated, except for the very ends,
4002    which are stripped clean.
4003    The wire is attached to the tower.
4004    The wire is tied to the knob in the stool.
3025    Glowing sphere
4001    Lying on the ground is a glowing sphere.
4002    The sphere is about ten centimeters in diameter. It is hollow,
4002    with rather thick walls. Inside is a smaller sphere, about one 
4002    centimeter in diameter. The glow seems to emanate from the
4002    whole inner wall it, but is brighter near where the small sphere
4002    rests. It is extremely heavy for its size. 
3026    Gooey latex
4001    Flowing from the bark of the tree is a large quantity of gooey
4001    latex. It flows down the tree making a rubbery coating. If you
4001    had a bucket you could collect a large quantity.
4002    There is a puddle of congealed latex here.
4003    A sticky layer of rubber covers the pole.
4004    It is a mildly viscous, very sticky liquid, with a faint 
4004    turpentine-like odor. If spread in a thin layer on something
4004    it soon congeals into a smooth, pliable, and only faintly sticky
4004    coating.
4005    It seems to have congealed into a solid mass.

4002    There is a beautiful orchid here.
4003    It is violet, white and magenta, about 20 cm across, and a
4003    striking example of the evolutionary similarity of this planet
4003    and the earth.

4003    spherical, sitting on four lightly sprung wheels. On top is
4003    what looks like a car antenna. Beneath that is a rotating TV
4003    camera. It has two arms, one of which is a rather delicate-
4003    looking clasping device. The other is a swivel-mounted hose
4003    arrangement obviously designed for it's primary purpose of
4003    watering plants. In the control section beneath the TV eye are
4003    a microphone and a speaker.    
4004    The robot is empty-handed.
4005    The robot holds:
3043    Statue
4001    There is a small statue here
4002    It is a carving of a ferret. The ferret is holding a small star.

4003    It looks like a small metallic grasshopper. The body is made
4003    of a gray semi-metallic substance which looks like silicon.
4003    The wings are a transparent red, as if made of some zinc or
4003    arsenic mineral. The eyes are bright iridescent blue-green.
4003    The thing is obviously a bit cold away from the fiery pit,
4003    but not in severe distress. The whole effect is as if some piece
4003    of precious jewelry had come to life.
3059    Piece of Xray film
4001    There is a piece of used xray film here.
4002    The xray film contains no useful image.
4003    The xray film, though not well exposed, contains the image of a

4001    Lying on the ground is a beautiful large violet crystal.
4002    It is a large crystal, very light for its size, with a pale 
4002    violet hue. It is probably spodumene, a mineral valuable for
4002    its content of lithium, which is used in your ship's drive.

4002    the vicinity. Some stars are described in script which you
4002    cannot read.
4003    This appears to be a souvenir map of the galaxy. Among prominent
4003    locations are the following:
4003     Location         Right ascension      Declination
4003     Altair                0556               2331
4003     Cygnus                2445               4293

4002    The writing is unintelligible.
4003    A banner at the top of the paper says "EXTRA".
4003    A subtitle says "Teleporter to Test Site #6 Reactivated".
4003    The gist of the article is that the teleportation link to
4003    the planet known as Test Site #6, which recently failed,
4003    causing district administrator Glathryx to arrive at the
4003    space station minus his third and fourth leg sets, and then
4003    became totally inoperative, has come back in operation. 
4003    It seems that an intruder into the test site is suspected
4003    of causing these recent events. All persons are requested
4003    to be on the lookout for at strange alien, whose description
4003    more or less fits you.
3073    Yellow rod
4001    There is a yellow rod here.
3074    Written note
4001    There is a piece of paper with a note on it here.
4002    The note is unintelligible.
4003    The note is partly obliterated by coffee stains, but you can
4003    just make out
4003      Do it twice 
4003      Door combinations ....
4003      Small ship   99  ??   ??
5001    Volcanic spire
4001    %%%%
4002    The spire, although steep, has many small rock flakes
4002    on which a person could stand if he had the right kind of shoes.
4003    Why not try to take a mountain. It's just as easy.
5002    Tiny pterodactyls
4001    They are rather cute but nasty creatures, with greenish-gray
4001    skin, venomous red eyes and long razorlike tails.
4002    That's not wise. They are vicious creatures and would bite you
4002    The bite of most animals here is fatal.
5003    Ceramic stool
4001    As you reach over to look at the stool, a spark jumps out from
4001    the knob in the center and shocks you.
4002    It's too heavy to lift.
5004    Metal knob
4001    As you get near the knob it gives you a painful but harmless
4001    electrical shock.

4002    If you wish me to give you a hernia, please say so directly.
5010    Horsetails
4001    Horsetails are primitive plants, which live today on earth 
4001    in wet cool forests. Today they are rather small, but 
4001    millions of years ago there were ones several meters tall.
4001    On this planet the large ones are still common. Here they
4001    form a line to the sides of the waterfall, where the spray
4001    keeps them wet. The pterodactyls seem to live somewhere
4001    behind them.
4002    Horsetails are used only to scour pans, which you don't have.
5011    Metal door
4001    The door is closed.

5012    Glass door
4001    The door is closed.
4002    The door is open.
4003    You can't take that. It's to big to get anywhere.
5013    Rabbit hole
4001    In the ground is a small hole, probably the entrance to a
4001    rabbit warren.
4002    In the ground is the gaping entrance of a bottomless pit.
4003    A hole is the absence of something. You can't take air. 
5014    Louver
4001    Someone has ransacked the louver. A gaping hole remains.
4002    Why bother?
5015    Grape vines

5019    Round button
4001    Not until you reach Nirvana.

4003    Don't kid me!
5034    Red light
4001    The red light is on.
4002    The red light is off.
4003    The red light comes off in your hand. (Sorry, just kidding.)
5035    Green light
4001    The green light is off.

5040    Orange button
4002    It is fixed in the wall.
5041    White button

4001    embarrassed that you carefully put the whole affair back.
5042    Blue button
4001    As you unscrew it, you notice that your nose falls off also.
4001    The switch it operated remains operational.

4002    Sitting in the green vapor is:
4003    The robot has no suitable container.
5046    Frogs
4001    These are quite ordinary frogs. They are green, a bit slimy, and
4001    make a hollow krrooooookkking sound. If you could converse with 
4001    them (which you can't), you would discover that their favorite
4001    topic of conversation is sex.
4002    Taken.   .......    but
4002    After a few moments the frog emits a foul-smelling slimy liquid
4002    which runs down your arm and begins to itch. You drop the poor
4002    creature.
5047    Red birds
4001    They seem to be parrots.
4002    They fly amongst the highest branches of the trees, far above 
4002    your reach. 
5048    Beautiful birds
4001    There are dozens of birds of all colors and sizes here. They 
4001    seem to like the most inaccessible branches of the small trees.
4002    They are well above your head. You can't climb the trees, as 
4002    their trunks are much too weak.
5049    Beautiful birds
4001    There are several different species: big red ones, little green 
4001    ones, ones with violet backs and white and yellow heads, and 
4001    many others. They seems to like the highest branches of the 
4001    trees.
4002    The birds are on the trees, not on the walkway where you stand.
5050    Beautiful birds.
4001    The birds are hidden by the top branches of the trees.
4002    They aren't nearby; they are out of reach in the trees.

4002    It is too big to get out the door.
5054    Waterfall
4001    Sorry, there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. There
4001    isn't even any rainbow, just lots of water.
4002    Have you perhaps been eating cactus hallucinogenic drugs?
5055    Vending machine
4001    There is a vending machine here.
4002    It looks exactly like the machines used on earth to dispense
4002    candy. The contents look like red balls about one centimeter
4002    in diameter. The label says "Ozmtfztv Krooh". It has a slot
4002    labeled &300.
4003    It looks exactly like the machines used on earth to dispense

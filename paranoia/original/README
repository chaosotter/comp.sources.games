  This is a very simple, but amusing, adventure game.  It is based on the
role-playing game "Paranoia".  It requires no instructions, as it is self-
prompting, and has been written in the simplest C that I could imagine, so
as to be implementable on almost any system.  This also means that it could
be translateable to any other language.

  Note that since it uses random functions to simulate dice rolls, it will
choose its own pathways in some circumstances, unlike many adventure games.
